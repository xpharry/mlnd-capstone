MLND Part 7: Capstone Proposal & Capstone Project.

## Project: Capstone Proposal

- [Capstone Proposal](./proposal/proposal.pdf)

A project proposal is listed here and a game bot is expected to be built with Deep Reinforcement Learning method.

## Project: Capstone Project

Followed by the Capstone Proposal, a project is established just as indicated in the proposal.

**A Game Bot Trained with Deep Q-Learning** [Report](./report/report.pdf)

### Overview:

This is an attempt at Sirajology's OpenAI Universe [coding challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGYU5t8MO7s&t=11s).

Well, it is surely long after the coding challenge. It is still worthy to try since it gives me much intuitive into Deep Reinforcement Learning. Also I treat it as my capstone project in my Machine Learning Nano Degree Program. It could be a perfect wrap up since it combines both the Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning and as a result it concludes a genereal pipeline to drive the computer (here it is the video game, Coaster Racer) to learn by itself. Just like the power it has shown in the famous competition between AlphaGo and Lee Sedo, Deep Reinforcement Learning has become a representative of Artificial Intelligence.

I personally feel motivated because I expect a great potential problem solving ability in my familiar areas, robotics and simulations. Video game bot is a perfect beginning and in the future the trained intelligence here can be transplanted to a real robot by Transfer Learning.

In this project, I start from simply a Q-Learning model and add in some deep learning models which has been proved powerful in other problems, like the model proposed in the DeepMind Nature paper, and also a model succefully trained a turtlebot moving in a maze. The model is expected to learn the flash game CoasterRacer based on its vision, namely the pixels of the screen, and the score generated by the game. Theoretically speaking the trained model would work for any implementation of a flash game within Universe providing the correct dimensions of the image crop and the similar inputs and outputs.

### Installation

#### Dependancies

* tensorflow
* cv2
* numpy
* random
* collections
* gym
* universe

### Usage:

#### 1) Training

Either run train.py to train the model or demo.py to see it in action. demo.py loads the tensors from the TF checkpoint files and runs the model. (Check the file name that this tries to resore from if you haven't left this to train completely using my code or have made any alterations.)
Note that train.py doesn't render anything and as such, needs to be VNCd into to see whats happening.

#### 2) Testing

### Video Demo
